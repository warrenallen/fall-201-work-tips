## The Pomodoro Technique:
The pomodoro Technique is used as a form of time management and work efficiency. The basis of the technique is to break down work sessions into 25 minute intervals in which focus and work efficiency have been shown to increase. The intervals and are meant for consistency rather than perfection. They create a more concious and concentrated worker. Each session is treated as a fresh start so that one can evaluate and progress from the previous interval making corrections and bettering their work

### Why You Should Try the Technique: 
1. Insterad of students spending many hours in one session knowingthat they cant stop until they finish can be uninviting. Breaking long study sessions into meaning full short study segments can cause a student to fell better about starting to study. 
2. This technique will lead to more retained information during studying since the student will be more concentrated and conscious of what they are studying. 
3. It also allows for the option to work on many different subjects instead of boring onself with one subject for many hours. Each following time slot can be arranged for a different subject allowing the student to progress in all subjects and not quit because of over exposure to on subject. 

4. If a student feels rushed and doesnt think they have enough time to start an entire assignement due to plans, the student may say "I have 25 min before I need to leave, I get as much done in this time slot".
