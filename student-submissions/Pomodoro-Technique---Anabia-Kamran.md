## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is actually quite fascinating to me which is why I decided to research more about it. Basically, this technique emphazises the importance of picking one task and working on that chosen task for 25 minutes undisturbed and unbroken minutes. Once those 25 minutes are up, you can take a 5 minute break and then get started on the next task for another 25 minutes. The breaks can then be increased to 15 to 30 minutes every time you complete 4 tasks. This technique was developed in the 1980s by someone called Francesco Cirillo who was unable to focus and began to feel overwhelmed. He challenged himself to try and focus for 10 minutes and this is essentially where the technique first started. Over time, this time management technique has become quite popular and has helped combat several people's daily procrastination struggles. It is now easier for individuals to manage their time better while not having their tasks feel so overwhelming and too much. 

### Why should you try the technique? 

1. Makes tasks seem less overwhelming so you're less prone to procrastination 
2. Less likely for an individual to become distracted because of the small allotted times 
3. Motivates individuals to get their work done when they begin to see progress 
4. Easier for those who cannot sit for a long period of time
