## About the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a very efficient tool for students to focus on studying. This consists of 4 intervals of 25 minutes with a 5 minute break in between and after the fourth study session is finished, there is a 15-30 minute break. This technique allows for one to give their entire focus on their assignment with enough breaks to give their brain a rest. 


### Why Should You Try This Technique?

1. Efficient way to stay focused on assignments.
2. This technique will certainly have a great balance of work to break ratio. Whereas without a set routine, students continually go on their phone, taking longer breaks than expected.
3. Will be in control the entire time and cut out distractions.
4. Increase accountability and motivation.
