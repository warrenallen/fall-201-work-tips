## Mindful Meditation

Mindful meditation ( known as focused-attention ) is the act of meditating by focusing on one particular thought or sensation. This can be anything from breathing of the feeling of your toes. Once you are in a comfortable position and you start meditating, start focusing on the one thought or sensation you chose. If your mind starts to wander, slowly real yourself back into your focus point. Just a few minutes a day can bring in a number of benefits.
