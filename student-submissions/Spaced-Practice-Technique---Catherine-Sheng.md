# Spaced Practice Technique

The Spaced Practice technique, also known as the distributed practice technique is a study method that uses its study time to be distributed or *spaced* out over a period of time. This method is the opposite of cramming, which is when the individual studies right before the exam, because the person uses their study time and space it out over several days. For example, a person cramming 4 hours before a text is less effective than a person studying and hour for 4 days.

## Why you should try spaced practice technique

 1. If you forget what you learned one day, the next day you can review what you forgotten to re-enforce the material. It combats the [forgetting curve](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/what-is-the-forgetting-curve/).
 2. This technique does not increase the time that you alloted for studying and works in collaboration with your attention span. If you planned out 7 hours to study, you can space the time out so you study one hour every day.
 3. You study old materials in addition to new materials at the same time. 
 4. You actually retain the information, because you must review through old material, rather than taking in information and "spitting it back out."
