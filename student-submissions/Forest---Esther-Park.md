## About The Forest App
The Forest app is a productivity app that prevents users from opening distracting apps on their phone such as social media or messaging apps while they study or do work. Procrastination occurs often when people open apps like Instagram or YouTube and mindlessly start scrolling through the seemingly endless posts or the never-ending list of videos to watch. This app allows people to just stay on the app until the timer finishes and their virtual tree is grown. Each time the user starts and ends a time of productivity, they will successfully have a tree planted in their forest!

### Why you should try this app
 1. This gives you some kind of incentive to be productive for a certain amount of time (grow more trees to add to your collection & gain coins to buy different kinds of trees and plants! :smile:)
 2. You will be less tempted to use different apps because if you exit the app, your tree will die :cry: and you don't want to see a dead tree in your forest
 3. You can use this app with your friends and keep each other accountable by planting a tree together (if one person in your group procrastinates, everyone's tree will die! :deciduous_tree:)
 4.  This app also provides a small selection of background sounds to help you stay focused (i.e. rain sounds and café jazz music :musical_note:)
