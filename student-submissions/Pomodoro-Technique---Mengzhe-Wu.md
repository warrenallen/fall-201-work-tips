## About the Pomodoro Technique

This technique was found in 1980s by Franceso Cirillo to improve the effiency of people's work. It needs people to arrange their time into periods of time which usually have 25-minute work and 5-minute relax. After 4 Pomodoros, there would be a long break (about 15-30 minutes). This will psychologically help people avoid overload and focus on work.
