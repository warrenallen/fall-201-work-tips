## Don't Break the Chain
Jerry Seinfeld created a producitivity technique where it was designed to help people in accomplishing tasks consistently, efficently and gradually. The technique uses a calendar, a list of goals to be completed each day and a marker to represent the completion of a daily task. The person using this method has to understand their goals and to start small for gradual accomplishments. Starting too big will backfire as having unrealistic goals will exhaust the person's will to be consistent. Another key factor in this method is placing the calendar where it is most prominent.
