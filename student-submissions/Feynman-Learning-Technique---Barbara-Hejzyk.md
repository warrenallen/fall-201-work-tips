## The Feynman Technique

The Feynman Learning Technique encourages deeper knowledge on a subject by filling in information gaps in a multi step process. The first step is to identify the topic being studied, and then explain the topic in a way a 12 year old would understand. Once you get stuck or cannot explain much more about the concept, you go back and try to fill in the gaps with the knowledge you are missing. This increases the true understanding of a topic and makes you retain information rather than just remembering the name and surface level information.

### Why Should You Try This Technique

1. Explaining the information on a 12 year old level simplifies the vocabulary and details that is easier to understand, because using elevated vocabulary does not always mean we have more knowledge.
2. This technique allows you to find the information gaps you might not even be aware of. 
3. Simplifying the concept to a 12 year old level means we will retain the information like a child as well, meaning we will ask "why?" and want to know deeper explanations.
4. It saves time when studying by targetting exactly what areas need more explanation and what areas are more comfortable. This way you don't waste time learning surface value information.
