## A Forest in the Hand...

Last class, we were able to discuss one of my favorite ways to study: **[The Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique)**! I'll be honest, Some days, even with the technique, I still lose focus and go on my phone. What was the solution? I discovered a way to plant real trees and stay productive at the same time!
