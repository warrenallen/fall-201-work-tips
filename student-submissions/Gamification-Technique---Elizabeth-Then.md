## Gamifying your Workplace 
Personally, I can't think of a better way of improving your productivity when working from home than to gamify your environment! A great way to enforce this technique is by using apps on your phone that encourage you to be productive in a playful manner. Incorporating games in your routine have many benefits, some of which could help you build new skills.
### Why should you try the technique?

1. Its Rewarding: you usually win something more than just being productive.
2. Helps keep you focused.
3.  You can have fun while being productive.
4. Keeps you motivated and entertained.
