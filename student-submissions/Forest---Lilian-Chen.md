## About Forest (iOS and Android app)

Forest is a productivity app for people who want to stop getting distracted by their phones. The user sets a timer, which plants a virtual seed that grows into a virtual tree during that time. If the user leaves the app, the tree withers and dies. The goal is to grow a forest of healthy trees by repeatedly and successfully completing the timed periods. Additionally, users can earn coins based on the times they set and the coins can be spent on planting real trees through the organization Trees For the Future.
