## The advantages of the Discord voice messaging, texting, and screen sharing application

Discord was originally created for online video gamers to chat with each other while playing games as well as to form their own online communites. Essentially, users would be able to create their own chats (or servers) where they could then invitie other users via an invite link. The server creator has moderator privllegaes and can set roles within the server for different types of users. Users may even choose to opt out of screen sharing, voice chatting, and the web cam option and just simply type text in their messaging box.


### Why should you try discord?

1. Discord is free
	 * Discord is 100% to set up a server. However, users who pay for the preimeum version of Discord (Discord nitro) may have more emoji, improved audio quality, special community badges, GIF profile pictures, and much more. They can even "*BOOST*" a server which means they can pay to help their own servers or other servers that they join have special improvements such as a larger chat room capacity, community logo gifs, and better audio qualities.

2. You don't need to download discord
	* Discord can be used on the browser. It is not required that you download. 
3. Bots
	* To improve server life, you can invite bots to your server that people have made. Bots carry out specific commands when invoked. Depending on what they do, the server moderators can set permissions so that only certain members or types of members can command them. So, a teacher for example can use a canvas bot which reminds all users that homework is due soon or has just been posted. 

4.	 Discord is free
		* Surely, Discord has a preimum service. However, much of Discord's functions are free and the add-ons are usually to increase capcities that are hard to meet. 

### Where to start?
To start using Discord, you can head over to www.discord.gg in order to download the application or use the browser version. Of course, you would first have to create an account. Why you create an account, head over to the plus sign (+) to either join a server or invite friends. Your username is not just the name you picked but also the four digit number granted to you upon your creation. 
	
	Example: USERNAME#1234
