## About the Forest App  

The Forest App is a tool that allows for better productivity and concentration on work that needs to be done. When you want to do some work, you simply go to the app and pick a time. The available times go from 10 minutes to 2 hours. When you set the timer, it starts planting a tree while you work. If you are tempted to look at your phone and you leave the app, you immediately get a notification that you need to go back to the Forest app to prevent your tree from dying. If you don't immediately go back to the app, the tree dies. Once you finish a section of time, you grow a tree and gradually start to collect them to build your own virtual forest. At the end of the week, you can see how much time you consistently worked through and where you got distracted. Also, when you collect trees, you receive coins. When you receive a certain amount of coins, you can use those coins to plant real trees throughout the world! 


### Why should you download the app?

1. It helps improve productivity and concentration because every time you leave the app, it immediately gives you a notification to go back and continue your work or else the tree will die. The notification really helps because it allows you to refocus and get right back to work. The notification is a reminder to stop getting distracted. 
2. The app allows you to do work in sections. Sometimes, students do work without taking breaks and they start to get tired and unproductive. With the small increments of time to stay focused, students can become more productive and can take breaks as soon as the timer goes off. 
3. While staying concentrated on your work, you actually earn coins to plant real trees throughout the world. You are helping yourself, but also contributing to the environment. It's really neat!
4. At the end of the day, week, or even month, you can see an overview of how focused you were and how many times you got distracted. You can see if you are actually staying focused and improving your productivity. One week, you might see that you were very distracted and barely planted any trees, so you can make a goal for yourself the following week to plant a certain amount of trees and decrease your distractions.
