## About the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo, is a technique designed to help with time management. It is used to help with accomplishing work and studying in more effective ways. Pomodoro is the Italian word for tomato, and here it is named after a tomato kitchen timer. The technique involves working in intervals of 25 minutes and then taking a short break of about 5 minutes. Each 25 minute interval is referred to as a pomodoro. A longer break of about 15 minutes should be taken after completing 4 pomodoros and working for a total of 100 minutes.
