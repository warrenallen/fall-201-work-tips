# Square Breathing

Today I'd like to share with you the wonderful technique of *square-breathing* (sometimes referred to as box-breathing).
Square breathing is typically thought to be a stress-reduction technique rather than a productivity technique, however it is certainly **hard to be productive when you're overly stressed** and we're living in some pretty stress-filled times! 
The technique has you set a metranome or keep a beat by tapping your foot or finger. Once you have established a beat you do the following:
1. Inahle for a count for 4
2. Hold for a count of 4
3. Exhale for a count of 4
4. Hold for a count of 4
5. *REPEAT*

This process accomplishes two things. First it distracts the mind from anything in front of us that may be generating anxiety. Second it reduces the fight-for-flight response, a sympathetic nervous system process, and instead encourages the parasympathic nervousystem to become engaged.

## Why you should try this technique:

1. Often we procrastinate because on some level (consciously or unconsciously) we are paralyzed by idea of how challenging a task will be, when in reality the task is often managable. **By reducing this anxiety you may procrastinate less**.
2. **Stress is distracting**. Even if we are not procrastinating, we still may find it harder to enter a flow-state or get "in the zone" if we're simultaniously trying to manage our mental state.
3. There's no reason square breathing needs to be limited to studying and homework alone. Often we need to present our work (for both school and in our careers) infront of a large crowd. Doing some **square breathing before a presentation** may reduce the severity of stage-fright.
4. **It's discrete!** This is something you can do privately to yourself anytime and anywehre without drawing attention to youself.
5. **Stress is simply bad for your health!** It can spill into other areas of our life, like affecting our sleep quality. Even more directly stress itself releases cortico-steroids like cortisol which are damaging to our bodies.
