## About the "active recall" technique 

Active recall is actually a studying and memorization technique that I learned freshman year here in General Biology 1. What active recall encourages is "active learning". What I mean by this is that the technique eliminates as much text reading from a resource (article, textbook, etc) as possible, which oftentimes results in "brute-force" memorization. A big portion of this technique requires that instead of taking notes directly from a textbook, one should first read a portion of the text, close the textbook, and then take notes based off what one remembers (short-term memory) without looking back at the text. Nobody will be able to recall everything on their first try. However, repetition of this process will allow information to transition into long-term memory much more efficiently than just plain reading memorization. 


### Why should you try the technique?

1. It is a scientifically-proven technique that is backed by lots of research 
2. It allows for information to transition into long-term memory
3. It is the best method that reveals your weak points and where you should focus your attention on
4. It is cost-efficient and does not require any extra tools or materials to use
