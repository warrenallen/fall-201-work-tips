## Forest: Stay Focused
Phones act as one of the biggest distractions for students, especially when doing schoolwork and studying for exams. Forest is a productivity timer app found on both Android and iOS that tackles this issue by eliminating this distraction so that individuals can be fully engaged with their task on hand. Denoted as the 2018 Google Play Editors' Choice Top Productivity app, Forest encourages its users to stay away from their smartphone through a unique approach. Whenever a timer is set, a tree or shrub begins growing on the user's device in a virtual forest. If users click out of the app, their growing tree will die, thus ruining the forest.

### Why should you try this technique?
1. When a tree is successfully planted (the user has not been distracted by their phone), the user is rewarded with coins. Furthermore, the tree is added to a long-term virtual forest that can be viewed later. Users can spend these coins to plant real trees for farmers in developing areas through **Trees for the Future**. This reward system allows one to improve themselves while simultaneously helping others around the world.

2. As a timer app, Forest can be used in conjunction with the Pomodoro technique. This is something that I have always done when hard studying for exams, and I have found it to be incredibly useful in promoting both my motivation and concentration.

3. While the virtual forest is an appealing aspect in itself, it also serves as a visual aid, so users know how productive they are truly being. Timeline overviews coupled with bar graphs denoting total minutes of focus done allow users to check their forest activity

4. "Plant together mode" is a Forest feature that strongly encourages focused work among peers. Users sync Forest accounts so that the withering of one person's tree will cause the withering of everyone else's trees. This feature becomes perfect for things like intense studying or even other things, such as movie nights or even family dinners.
